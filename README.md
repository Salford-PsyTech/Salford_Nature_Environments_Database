# Salford Nature Environments Database (SNED).

The Salford Nature Environments Database is a collection of 500 images of various environments, developed for use in cognitive restoration and affective science research. 435 of these images are of natural scenes, with 65 control images showing urban scenes. Natural images include a variety of settings, including; water (lakes, oceans, rivers, and waterfalls), woodlands, landscapes (fields, mountains, and snow), caves, and managed landscapes (gardens, reservoirs, and farmland).

801 participants provided ratings for 100 images, using bipolar semantic scales, to indicate levels of; arousal, valence, approach/avoidance, pleasantness, familiarity, mystery, interest, and prospect/refuge. 
This resulted in a total of 640,267 ratings, with between 154 and 168 ratings per parameter per image.

For each image, authors also calculated a variety of physical parameters; luminance, contrast, entropy, CIELAB colourspace values, and fractal dimension.
This information is available within the 'Data_ImageLevel_allOutputs' CSV file.
<p></p>
All of the rated images are contained in the 'Images' folder. Original, unedited versions of the images can be found in the 'Original_Images' folder.
<p></p>
Links to the original images, details on the image creator and data about the original image size is also provided.
This information is available within the 'ImagesBook_CollatedImagesData' CSV and xls files. Both files contain perma-links to the original files, while the xls file has working links to the Flickr page where Exif  data can be found.
